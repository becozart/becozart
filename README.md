### Hey all 💯

A bit about me:  
Currently, I'm working as a software engineer at Shopify 🛍️.  
I'm also a computer science graduate student at Penn Engineering 📚.  

I'm passionate about justice in tech and the workforce in general, particularly for women, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, neurodiverse, and disabled people, immigrants, first generation college grads, bootcamp grads, entry level workers, and veterans. If you're in one of these groups and interested in tech, let me know how I can help you!  

I'm perpetually curious. 💭  
Some things I want to learn / learn about next:  
Linux, OS’s, vim
