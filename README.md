### Hey all ðŸ’¯

A bit about me:  
Currently, I'm working as a software engineer II at Flexport ðŸ“¦.  
I'm also a computer science graduate student at Penn Engineering ðŸ“š.  

I'm passionate about justice in tech and the workforce in general, particularly for women, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, neurodiverse, and disabled people, immigrants, first generation college grads, bootcamp grads, entry level workers, and veterans. If you're in one of these groups and interested in tech, let me know how I can help you!  

I'm perpetually curious. ðŸ’­  
Some things I want to learn / learn about next:  
Machine Learning

PS: My contribution graph looks a bit sparse... ðŸ˜¦ It's because I've been building great things in private at Deliverr, Shopify, and Flexport! ðŸ˜ƒ 
Checkout my Linkedin and send me a message: I'd love to chat about my recent work!
